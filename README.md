The main aim of our project is to help people become aware of forest fire depending on the various weather aspects so that they can save themselves by escaping such disaster.

We used Logistic Regression to train the model on the dataset file which consists of the following values: Oxygen content in ppm, Temperature in celsius and the Humidity %.

The model which is trained is saved as a pickle file which is then later used for deploying the model on the website which uses this model to make predictions based on user input. The model helps us to predict the probability of the occurence of forest fire.
